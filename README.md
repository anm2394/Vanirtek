# Vanirtek
The work done with Vanirtek, a Norwegian Fintech startup. Most of the original codes are in R. I am working on converting them to Python, will be active in the space.
The work focused on portfolio optimization. We used HRP algorithm to define weights, and worked on performance measures. The ETFs can be increased to increase the portfolio.
There are other stock rotation strategies that we can worked on and smart beta strategies. I will post based on completion and permissions granted.
